<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

### About me

I’m a Jiamu 'Morris' Zhang, second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University (advisor: Xia 'Ben' Hu). 

My research focuses on efficient and robust machine learning, particularly in large language models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and reasoning-aware evaluation. I'm broadly interested in developing practical and theoretically grounded approaches to make foundation models faster, safer, and more reliable.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. in Department of Computer and Data Science from Case Western Reserve University (advisor: Shuai Xu and Vipin Chaudhary), where I worked on model compression and adversarial robustness.

I'm really passionate about building open, efficient, and reliable AI systems. Feel free to reach out!
